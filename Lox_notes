- LEXICAL GRAMMAR:
	The rules that determine how a particular language groups
	characters into lexemes.


- MAXIMAL MUNCH:
	When two lexical grammar rules can both match a chunk of code
	that the scanner is looking at, WHICHEVER ONE MATCHES THE MOST
	CHARACTERS WINS.
	
- RESERVED WORD:
	Can be defined as an identifier, but one that has been claimed
	by the language for its own use.
	
- FORMAL GAMMARS:
	A formal grammar takes a set of atomic pieces it calls its
	"alphabet". Then it defines a (usually infinite) set of 
	"strings" that are "in" the grammar. Each string is a sequence
	of "letters" in the alphabet. A formal grammar's job is to
	specify which strings are valid and which aren't.
	
- VISITOR PATTERN:
	Is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate the
	algorithms or behaviors from the objects on which they operate.
	
- DOUBLE DISPATCH:
	Since the objects know their own classes, the main idea is to
	delegate choosing the proper method to the object itself
	instead of letting the cliend select a method.
	
- Lox EBNF:

expression	-> equality

equality	-> comparison (("!=" | "==") comparison)*;

comparison	-> term ((">" | ">=" | "<" "<=") term)*;

term		-> factor(("-" | "+") factor)*;

factor		-> unary (("/" | "*") unary)*;

unary 		-> ("!" | "-") unary
	       	 | primary;
	
primary 	-> NUMBER

		 | "true"
		 | "false"

		 | "(" expression ")";
